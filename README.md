## Usage

### From the command line

#### Logging in to your La Marzocco account

The recommended way to use the CLI is with the persistent login system:

1. **Login once and store credentials** (recommended):
   ```bash
   lm login
   # You'll be prompted for username and password
   # Credentials are securely stored in ~/.lm.yml
   
   # Now you can use any command without providing credentials again
   lm machines
   lm on
   lm off
   ```

   You can also provide credentials directly to the login command:
   ```bash
   lm login --username your@email.com --password yourpassword
   ```

2. **Logout to clear stored credentials**:
   ```bash
   lm logout
   ```

3. **Alternative: Command line arguments** (not recommended):
   ```bash
   lm --username your@email.com --password yourpassword machines
   ```

4. **Alternative: Environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export LM_USERNAME="your@email.com"
   export LM_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
   lm machines
   ```

**Note**: The CLI will automatically refresh access tokens as needed. If stored credentials become invalid, you'll be prompted to run `lm login` again.

#### Viewing the status of your machine(s) 

```bash
lm machines
```

You'll see all of the machines connected to your account, with their status:

```
Model                Name                           Location             Serial               Status

Linea Mini          Office Espresso                Work                 LM56789              Standby   
GS3 MP              Garage Machine                 Garage               GS98765              Unavailable
```

#### Turning on a machine

```bash
# Turn your one and only machine on
lm on

# Turn your machine on, wait until the coffee boiler is ready to go, then exit and trigger a notification
lm on --wait

# Turn on a specific machine, specified by serial number
lm on --serial ABC123
```

#### Turning off a machine (standby mode)

```bash
# Switch your one and only machine into standby
lm off

# Switch a specific machine into standby mode, specified by serial number
lm off --serial ABC123
```
