## Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed, then build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/lm`.

## Usage

### Authentication

The recommended way to use the CLI is with the persistent login system:

1. **Login once and store credentials** (recommended):
   ```bash
   lm login
   # You'll be prompted for username and password
   # Credentials are securely stored in ~/.lm.yml
   
   # Now you can use any command without providing credentials again
   lm machines
   lm on
   lm off
   ```

   You can also provide credentials directly to the login command:
   ```bash
   lm login --username your@email.com --password yourpassword
   ```

2. **Logout to clear stored credentials**:
   ```bash
   lm logout
   ```

3. **Alternative: Command line arguments** (not recommended):
   ```bash
   lm --username your@email.com --password yourpassword machines
   ```

4. **Alternative: Environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export LM_USERNAME="your@email.com"
   export LM_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
   lm machines
   ```

**Note**: The CLI will automatically refresh access tokens as needed. If stored credentials become invalid, you'll be prompted to run `lm login` again.
